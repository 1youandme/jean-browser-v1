# Jean Project Roadmap: The Path to Sovereign Computing
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2026-01-01  
**Owner:** Program Director  
**Status:** Approved for Board Review  

---

## Phase 1: The "Safe Observer" (Months 0–3)
**Objective:** Establish the governance baseline. Prove that Jean can analyze and plan without being dangerous. The system must be "Fail-Closed" by default.

### Capabilities Delivered
*   **Kernel Governance Engine:** The "Law" of the system. Enforces deny-by-default execution.
*   **Local Vector Memory:** File-based semantic search (SQLite + Vector). No cloud reliance.
*   **Read-Only Services:**
    *   *Travel:* Transparent flight/hotel search (No booking).
    *   *Commerce:* Sovereign product catalog (No ordering).
*   **Co-Founder "Analyst":** Feasibility studies and market research only.

### Governance Constraints
*   **Execution:** 100% blocked. No side effects allowed.
*   **Network:** Whitelist only (Approved APIs).
*   **Data:** Local-only storage.

### Explicitly Postponed
*   Real-money transactions.
*   Hardware integration (Camera/Mic).
*   Third-party plugin marketplace.

## Phase 2: The "Pipeline Pilot" (Months 3–6)
**Objective:** Enable execution through explicit, user-owned pipelines. Move from "Passive Analysis" to "Active Assistance" without ceding control.

### Capabilities Delivered
*   **Pipeline Builder UI:** Visual tool for users to link "Intent" to "Action" (e.g., "Booking Pipeline").
*   **Sovereign Commerce Beta:** Manual-verification supplier onboarding.
*   **Co-Founder "Planner":** Task decomposition and roadmap generation.
*   **Identity Wallet:** DID-based user profile for signing actions.

### Governance Constraints
*   **Pipeline Binding:** Execution requires cryptographic signature from a registered pipeline.
*   **Audit Logging:** Every state change is recorded in an immutable local ledger.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Strict caps on API calls to prevent runaway costs.

### Explicitly Postponed
*   Autonomous decision making (AI cannot sign for User).
*   Hardware HAL.
*   Complex multi-leg logistics.

---

## Phase 3: The "Physical Bridge" (Months 6–12)
**Objective:** Secure the boundary between the digital OS and the physical world. Begin integrating logistics and hardware sensors.

### Capabilities Delivered
*   **Governance HAL (Software):** Android wrapper for Pixel/Fairphone. "Soft" kill switches.
*   **Logistics Engine v1:** Multi-leg routing with approval gates (Driver -> Customs -> Ship).
*   **Co-Founder "Admin":** Capable of executing low-risk tasks (email drafting, calendar management).
*   **Travel Booking:** End-to-end booking via user pipelines.

### Governance Constraints
*   **Hardware Intent:** Apps must declare "Intent" (e.g., "Scan Receipt"), not just request permissions.
*   **Supply Chain Reputation:** Logistics providers vetted by governance score.
*   **Financial Caps:** Hard limits on wallet spending per day.

### Explicitly Postponed
*   Custom hardware manufacturing.
*   Autonomous financial trading.
*   General-purpose web browsing (without isolation).

---

## Phase 4: The "Sovereign Ecosystem" (Months 12–24)
**Objective:** Economic and hardware independence. Reduce reliance on legacy infrastructure (Google/Apple hardware, Amazon Cloud).

### Capabilities Delivered
*   **Jean Reference Device:** Partner-built hardware (Nokia/HMD) with physical kill switches.
*   **Decentralized Logistics:** Peer-to-peer shipping coordination.
*   **Offline License Proofs:** Tokenized ownership of software/models.
*   **Local LLM Fine-Tuning:** The "Co-Founder" learns from the user's specific business history.

### Governance Constraints
*   **Physical Sovereignty:** Hardware switches override all software states.
*   **Economic Policy:** Automated tax/compliance checks for sovereign commerce.

### Explicitly Postponed
*   **AGI (Artificial General Intelligence):** We are building a Tool, not a Species. Jean remains a servant, not a master.
