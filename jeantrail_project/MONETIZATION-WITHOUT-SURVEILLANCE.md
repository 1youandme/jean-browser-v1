# Monetization Without Surveillance

## Overview
This document defines the business model for JeanTrail, ensuring financial sustainability while strictly adhering to the "No Surveillance" core principle. The model relies on three pillars: **Static Sponsorships**, **Enterprise Licenses**, and **Opt-in Paid Features**.

## 1. Static Sponsorships ("Ethical Ads")

### Philosophy
We reject the surveillance capitalism model of behavioral tracking and real-time bidding. Instead, we implement "Static Sponsorships" similar to print media or podcast reads.

### Implementation
-   **Source:** `src-tauri/src/monetization.rs`
-   **Mechanism:**
    -   Sponsorships are hardcoded or loaded from a static, signed configuration file.
    -   **No JavaScript Trackers:** Sponsorships are simple image/text assets.
    -   **No User Targeting:** All users see the same sponsorships (or randomized from a pool) regardless of their behavior.
    -   **Transparency:** Clearly labeled as "Sponsor".
-   **Data Structure:**
    ```rust
    pub struct Sponsorship {
        pub name: String,
        pub image_url: String, // Hosted on our static CDN, no cookies
        pub link_url: String,  // Direct link, UTM allowed but no intermediate redirect tracker
        pub is_active: bool,
    }
    ```

## 2. Enterprise Licenses

### Philosophy
Large organizations require specific features (compliance, audit logs, multi-user management) that are complex to build and maintain. We monetize these high-value features.

### Implementation
-   **Source:** `src-tauri/src/security.rs`, `src-tauri/src/monetization.rs`
-   **Tiers:**
    1.  **Free:** Individual use, local storage, basic features.
    2.  **Pro:** Power users, priority support, encrypted cloud sync.
    3.  **Enterprise:** Organization-wide control, SSO, Policy Engine, Audit Logs.
-   **Verification:**
    -   Offline-first verification using cryptographic signatures (`verify_offline()`).
    -   No "phone home" required to start the application.

## 3. Opt-in Paid Features (Feature Gating)

### Philosophy
Users should pay for *value*, not for their data. Advanced features are gated behind a valid license.

### Implementation
-   **Source:** `src-tauri/src/monetization.rs`
-   **Mechanism:**
    -   `MonetizationManager` checks the active `License` against the requested `PaidFeature`.
    -   **Graceful Degradation:** If a feature is not available, the UI hides it or shows an upgrade prompt, but the core functionality remains intact.
-   **Gated Features:**
    -   `EncryptedCloudSync`: Secure backup across devices (Pro/Ent).
    -   `PolicyEngine`: Enforce company-wide rules (Ent).
    -   `AuditLogs`: Compliance tracking (Ent).
    -   `CustomBranding`: White-labeling (Ent).

## Revenue Flow
1.  **Individual Users:** Use for free (supported by Ethical Ads) or upgrade to Pro for convenience (Sync/Support).
2.  **Enterprises:** Pay per-seat/site license for Control and Compliance features.
3.  **Sponsors:** Pay for static placement visibility to our privacy-conscious audience.
