# Jean Certified Ecosystem & Governance

## Overview
The Jean Ecosystem relies on a trust-but-verify model. While the platform is open for local use, the "Certified" tier ensures that enterprise and non-technical users can install extensions and integrations with confidence. This document outlines the governance, audit, enforcement, and onboarding processes.

## 1. Audit & Certification Process

### Levels of Trust
1.  **Local/Dev (Unverified):** User can install any plugin locally. Warnings are displayed. No "Verified" badge.
2.  **Community Verified:** Automated analysis checks for known malware patterns and permission overreach.
3.  **Certified Partner:** Fully audited by the Jean Governance Board. Code review + Identity verification.

### The Audit Pipeline
1.  **Static Analysis:**
    *   Manifest validation (`validate_plugin_manifest` in `plugins.rs`).
    *   Permission scope check (e.g., does a calculator app request `network.request`?).
2.  **Dynamic Analysis:**
    *   Sandbox execution monitoring.
    *   API call tracing.
3.  **Manual Review (for Certified Tier):**
    *   Code review for obfuscation.
    *   Business logic verification.

## 2. Enforcement Mechanisms

### Runtime Enforcement
The Jean Core runtime enforces security policies at the architectural level.

*   **Signature Verification:**
    *   **Source:** `src-tauri/src/plugins.rs` -> `verify_plugin_signature()`
    *   All "Certified" plugins MUST bear a cryptographic signature from a valid `CertifiedPartner`.
    *   The signature covers the entire `PluginManifest`, ensuring no tampering with permissions or entry points.

*   **Permission Boundaries:**
    *   Plugins operate in a sandbox.
    *   Access to sensitive APIs (Filesystem, Network, AI) is denied unless explicitly granted in `permissions` AND approved by the user.

### Policy Engine Integration
*   **Source:** `src-tauri/src/jean_permissions.rs` -> `LocalPolicyEngine`
*   Enterprise policies can be set to "Allow Only Certified Plugins", automatically blocking any extension that doesn't have a valid signature from a partner with `compliance_level: "Gold"`.

## 3. Revocation Transparency

We maintain a public, transparent **Revocation List** (CRL) to handle compromised keys or malicious actors.

### Data Structure
**Source:** `src-tauri/src/security.rs`
```rust
pub struct RevocationRecord {
    pub id: Uuid,
    pub entity_id: String, // Plugin ID or Partner ID
    pub reason: String,    // e.g., "Key Compromise", "Malware Detected"
    pub revoked_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    pub severity: String,  // "critical", "policy_violation"
}
```

### The "Kill Switch" Mechanism
1.  **Distribution:** The CRL is distributed via a decentralized peer-to-peer network (Local Hub) and an optional static HTTPS endpoint.
2.  **Enforcement:**
    *   On startup, Jean checks the local CRL.
    *   If a loaded plugin or partner key is found in the CRL, it is immediately disabled (`is_active = false`).
    *   The user is notified with the `reason` from the record.
3.  **Transparency:** The CRL is append-only and cryptographically signed by the Governance Root Key.

## 4. Partner Onboarding

To become a `CertifiedPartner`, an entity must pass our vetting process.

### Onboarding Steps
1.  **Identity Verification:** Business registration or individual identity proof (KYC).
2.  **Key Generation:** Partner generates a keypair locally. The Public Key is submitted to Jean Governance.
3.  **Compliance Pledge:** Partner signs the "No-Surveillance Pledge" (legally binding).
4.  **Issuance:**
    *   Jean Governance adds the partner to the `CertifiedPartner` registry.
    *   **Source:** `src-tauri/src/security.rs`
    ```rust
    pub struct CertifiedPartner {
        pub name: String,
        pub public_key: String,
        pub compliance_level: String, // "Gold", "Silver", "Bronze"
        pub status: PartnerStatus,    // Active, Suspended, Revoked
    }
    ```

### Compliance Levels
*   **Bronze:** Identity Verified. Good for basic utilities.
*   **Silver:** Automated Security Audit Passed. Good for productivity tools.
*   **Gold:** Full Code Audit + Legal Liability Coverage. Required for handling PII or financial data.
