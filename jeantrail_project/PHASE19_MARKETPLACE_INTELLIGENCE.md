**Phase 19 – Tool & Service Marketplace Intelligence**
- Suggestions ≠ ads
- User trust > monetization
- Intelligence without pressure

**MarketplaceItem**
- `type`: tool | service | plugin
- `capability`: string[]
- `useCases`: string[]
- `benefits?`: discounts, trials (optional)

**Suggestion Engine**
- Detects intent patterns symbolically
- Never interrupts user flow
- Suggestions are optional and dismissible
- Non-repeating unless context changes
- Discounts suggested only when clearly relevant

**Constraints**
- Additive only
- No payments
- No ads
- No behavioral manipulation
- Advisory, not coercive
