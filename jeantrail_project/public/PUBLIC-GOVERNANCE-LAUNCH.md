# Jean Governance Framework: v1.0 Launch

**Date:** December 30, 2024  
**Status:** Effective Immediately  
**Audience:** Developers, Partners, and Enterprise Users

## Overview

We are announcing the release of the **Jean Governance Framework v1.0**. This set of protocols defines how the Jean ecosystem operates, verifies software, and enforces security standards. Our objective is to provide a transparent, verifiable structure that ensures user sovereignty and software supply chain integrity without relying on opaque centralized control.

This framework is built on three core pillars: **Certified Trust**, **Transparent Enforcement**, and **Surveillance-Free Sustainability**.

## 1. The Certified Ecosystem

We have established a tiered trust model to balance developer freedom with enterprise security requirements.

*   **Local/Dev:** Users retain full control to install any local software. No restrictions are placed on personal development or private usage.
*   **Community Verified:** Automated static analysis checks for known malware patterns and permission overreach.
*   **Certified Partner:** A formal verification tier for entities requiring high trust.
    *   **Cryptographic Verification:** All certified extensions must bear a valid signature from a known `CertifiedPartner` key.
    *   **Identity Verification:** Partners undergo identity checks to ensure accountability.
    *   **Code Audit:** "Gold" level partners are subject to full manual code reviews.

**Documentation:** [JEAN-CERTIFIED-ECOSYSTEM.md](./JEAN-CERTIFIED-ECOSYSTEM.md)

## 2. Enforcement and Due Process

Security is enforced through rigorous, predictable protocols. We reject arbitrary bans in favor of a documented due process.

*   **Severity Levels:** Violations are categorized from **Low** (Warning) to **Critical** (Global Ban), with specific definitions for each.
*   **Transparency:** All revocations are published to a public, append-only **Revocation List (CRL)** with the specific reason and severity level cited.
*   **Due Process:**
    *   Partners are notified of non-critical violations 48 hours before suspension.
    *   An independent appeal process is available for contested decisions.
    *   Reinstatement paths are clearly defined, requiring root cause analysis and re-auditing.

## 3. Sustainable Independence

We are publishing our business model to clarify our financial incentives. Jean does not, and will never, sell user data or behavioral analytics.

*   **Ethical Sponsorships:** We support the platform via static, non-tracking placements. These are strictly image/text assets with no JavaScript trackers or real-time bidding.
*   **Enterprise Licensing:** Revenue is generated by selling advanced control features (Audit Logs, Policy Engines) to organizations, not by monetizing individual user data.
*   **Offline Verification:** License checks are performed locally and offline, ensuring no "phone home" requirement for core functionality.

## Next Steps

The Governance Board is now accepting applications for the **Certified Partner** program. Developers are encouraged to review the compliance documentation and prepare their manifests for signature verification.
