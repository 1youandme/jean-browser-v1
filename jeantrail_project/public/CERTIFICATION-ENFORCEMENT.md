# Certification Enforcement & Governance Standards

## Overview
This document defines the rigorous enforcement standards for the Jean Certified Ecosystem. It establishes a clear, transparent due process for handling policy violations, ensuring that the platform remains secure while treating partners fairly.

## 1. Severity Levels

Violations are categorized by their impact on user privacy, security, and trust.

### Level 1: Low (Warning)
*   **Definition:** Minor administrative or non-security policy breaches.
*   **Examples:**
    *   Incomplete manifest metadata.
    *   Broken support links.
    *   Minor UI guidelines violations.
*   **Action:** Private warning issued. 7-day remediation window.
*   **Status:** Partner remains `Active`.

### Level 2: Medium (Suspension)
*   **Definition:** Potential security risk or significant policy disregard requiring investigation.
*   **Examples:**
    *   Requesting sensitive permissions (e.g., `network.request`) without justification.
    *   Sudden spike in user crash reports.
    *   Unverified change in ownership.
*   **Action:** Temporary suspension. Entity disabled in "Certified" mode.
*   **Status:** Partner set to `Suspended`.

### Level 3: High (Revocation)
*   **Definition:** Confirmed security breach or intentional policy violation.
*   **Examples:**
    *   Data exfiltration attempt.
    *   Obfuscated code detected during audit.
    *   Failure to remediate Level 2 issues.
*   **Action:** Certificate revocation. Added to CRL.
*   **Status:** Partner set to `Revoked`.

### Level 4: Critical (Global Ban / Kill Switch)
*   **Definition:** Malicious intent, malware distribution, or cryptographic compromise.
*   **Examples:**
    *   Ransomware behavior.
    *   Private key leakage.
    *   Active exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities.
*   **Action:** Immediate global kill switch via P2P propagation. Legal action.
*   **Status:** Partner set to `Revoked` with `Critical` severity.

## 2. Due Process Workflow

We adhere to a "Fair Hearing" principle unless immediate user harm is imminent.

### Phase 1: Detection & Triage
*   **Sources:** Automated analysis, User reports, Security audits.
*   **Triage:** Governance Board assigns initial Severity Level.

### Phase 2: Notification & Action
*   **Non-Urgent (Low/Medium):** Partner notified via secure channel. 48-hour response window before suspension.
*   **Urgent (High/Critical):** Immediate action taken to protect users. Notification sent simultaneously.

### Phase 3: Investigation
*   Governance Board reviews evidence (logs, code, reports).
*   Partner may submit counter-evidence.

### Phase 4: Determination
*   Final ruling issued: **Dismissed**, **Upheld**, or **Escalated**.
*   Public transparency report updated.

### Phase 5: Appeal
*   Partners have 14 days to appeal High/Critical decisions.
*   Appeals are reviewed by an independent rotating committee of "Gold" partners.

## 3. Evidence Requirements

Enforcement actions must be backed by verifiable evidence.

*   **Technical Evidence:**
    *   **Audit Logs:** Signed `AuditLog` entries showing unauthorized API access.
    *   **Traffic Analysis:** PCAP files or network logs showing data exfiltration.
    *   **Code Diff:** Specific lines of code violating the "No Surveillance" pledge.
*   **Social Evidence:**
    *   **User Reports:** Pattern of verified user complaints (minimum 5 independent reports).
    *   **External Intelligence:** CVEs or reports from trusted security firms.

## 4. Reinstatement Criteria

The path to redemption depends on the severity of the violation.

### For Suspensions (Level 2)
1.  **Remediation:** Fix the identified issue.
2.  **Re-Audit:** Pass a targeted automated audit.
3.  **Statement:** Acknowledge the issue and preventative steps.

### For Revocations (Level 3)
1.  **Root Cause Analysis (RCA):** Submit a detailed RCA document.
2.  **Full Audit:** Mandatory full manual code review (at partner's expense).
3.  **Probation:** 90-day "Silver" status with enhanced monitoring before restoring "Gold" status.

### For Critical Bans (Level 4)
*   **Permanent:** No reinstatement allowed for the specific entity identity.
*   **Appeal:** Only on grounds of "False Positive" with conclusive forensic proof.
